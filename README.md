# TestScribe for Python - unit test made easier

A tool to make python unit testing easier by automating the boring and repetitive parts.

Do you wish you don't have to write assertions before a test is run but just visually verify the
result just like you would with testing a web page?

Do you write unit tests but don't like the overhead (create a file, name a function, write assertions...) 
or repetitiveness?

Have you experienced adjusting the mocking code multiple times before it allows the test to run? 
Do you have to refer to documentation from time to time to figure out how to mock or assert complex 
mock call parameters?

Do you wish to start a debugging session to understand a function better 
with as little overhead as possible?

Are you looking for an intuitive tool to help improve your code and coding skills?

This tool can help. It will
- ask for inputs only and show you the test result.
- take care of the repetitive and boring part of unit testing such as invoking the target function, 
creating files and functions with proper conventions, generating the assertions...
- interactively prompt for the mock object's behavior in context with information such as the call stack.
- generate complete working test code, which can serve as regression tests, examples and basis 
for further customization.
- and more. Please see [the complete documentation](#documentation).

# A simple example

Here is a very basic simple example to illustrate the basic usage.
Suppose you have a function called is_prime in a file prime.py. It checks if the input
number is a prime number. You can unit test the function using TestScribe without writing any boilerplate 
unit test code as follows:

    $ testscribe create prime.py is_prime
    ...
    Please provide the value for the parameter (n) of type: (int) []: 8
    Calling is_prime(n=8)
    ***** Result:
    type: <class 'bool'>
    value:
    False
    ***** Result end

Notice the only input you need to provide is the number 8.

You can run it multiple times with different inputs and inspect the displayed output.
If the output is not correct, fix the production code and test again.

TestScribe automatically creates fully functional unit test files. You can use them to debug a test run or save
them as regression tests or simply discard them. 

The example above generates the following test file test_prime_g.py
    
    from prime import is_prime
    def test_is_prime():
        result = is_prime(n=8)
        assert result is False

This is the code you would likely have to write to unit test the same without TestScribe's help.

Below is a short demo video for the example above.

The benefits will become more significant for more complex scenarios.

is an example involving mocks with an embedded demo video.

# Easy to get started and setup
Adding testscribe to your development dependencies is all you need to start using the basic features.
Most of the features should be self-explanatory to developers.
Additional features such as launching the tool more easily only require simple setups. 

# Low risk to try
* The tool doesn't modify the code you test in any way.
* It doesn't introduce any dependency to your production code.
* At any time, removing the tool won't break your existing production code or tests.
* It's free and open source with the Apache 2.0 license.
* You can always fall back to the traditional ways of testing for use cases the tool doesn't support yet. 
The tool won't get in your way.
