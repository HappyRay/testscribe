# TestScribe: Unit test made easy

A tool to make python unit testing easier by automating the boring and repetitive parts.

# The idea
Unit tests should be as intuitive as testing a web page. 
Developers should be able to test a function by providing inputs interactively and 
verify outputs visually. Note that 
* mock objects' attributes and mock methods' return values are inputs
* parameter values to mock method calls are outputs

Additionally, the test runs are recorded both as traditional unit tests 
and a structured machine-readable format by the tool automatically. 
The machine-readable format will enable additional functionalities such as maintaining 
regression tests.
